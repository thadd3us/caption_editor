Replace imports:\n   ```ts\n   // Before\n   import { test, expect, _electron as electron } from '@playwright/test'\n   \n   // After  \n   import { sharedElectronTest as test, expect } from './helpers/shared-electron'\n   ```\n\n2. Remove beforeEach/afterEach that launch/close Electron\n3. Change test signature to receive `{ page }` or `{ electronApp, page }`\n4. Replace `window.` with `page.`\n\nTests that need their own Electron instance (ASR tests, file-save tests that need fresh state):\n- tests/electron/asr-*.spec.ts\n- tests/electron/file-save-*.spec.ts  \n- tests/electron/unsaved-changes.electron.spec.ts","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"thad@imbue.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T10:45:43.711162-08:00","created_by":"Thad Hughes","updated_at":"2026-01-19T13:08:43.825887-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T13:08:43.825887-08:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
